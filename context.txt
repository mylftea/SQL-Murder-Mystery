A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

step 1 Query the info
Select * from crime_scene_report 
where date = 20180115 
and type = "murder"
and city = "SQL City"

date	    type	description	city
20180115	murder	Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".	SQL City

Step 2 Get the info of 1st and 2nd witnesses
I'll try for the second witness first because it have a lot of info

Select person.id,
person.name,
person.address_street_name,
interview.transcript

From person inner Join interview On person.id=interview.person_id

where name like "Annabel%" and address_street_name = "Franklin Ave"
;

id	    name	        address_street_name	transcript
16371	Annabel Miller	Franklin Ave	    I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

Step 3 Query all the list of interview untill you find transcript that connect to murder
Select * From interview ;

14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
67318	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

Step 4 connect all data

Select person.id,
person.name,
person.address_street_name,
interview.transcript

from person
inner join interview on person.id=interview.person_id

where id=14887;

id	    name	        address_street_name	transcript
14887	Morty Schapiro	Northwestern Dr	    I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Step 6 Query the info you Get
SELECT  person.id,
get_fit_now_member.person_id,
get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id,
drivers_license.plate_number,
get_fit_now_member.membership_status,
get_fit_now_member.name
FROM get_fit_now_member,get_fit_now_check_in, drivers_license
INNER JOIN person 
ON get_fit_now_member.person_id=person.id 
and get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id=get_fit_now_member.id
where membership_status = "gold" and membership_id like "48Z%" 
and plate_number like "H42W%"
;	

id	    person_id	membership_id	plate_number	membership_status	name
67318	67318	    48Z55	        H42W0X	        gold	            Jeremy Bowers
28819	28819	    48Z7A	        H42W0X	        gold	            Joe Germuska

Step 7 you have the same id with Jeremy Bowers you can start verifiyng Now

Select interview.person_id,
person.name,
interview.transcript

from person inner join interview on person.id=interview.person_id

where person_id = 67318

person_id	name	        transcript
67318	    Jeremy Bowers	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

Finally You Found The Murderer
Did you find the killer?
Miranda Priestly
1
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
2
        
3
        SELECT value FROM solution;

value
Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, 
try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

Finding the Mastermind
SELECT DISTINCT person.id, 
person.name,
drivers_license.gender,
drivers_license.height,
drivers_license.hair_color,
drivers_license.car_make,
drivers_license.car_model,
facebook_event_checkin.event_name

FROM drivers_license, facebook_event_checkin
INNER JOIN person 
ON person.license_id=drivers_license.id

where hair_color = "red" 
and gender = "female" 
and car_make="Tesla" 
and car_model ="Model S"
and event_name ="SQL Symphony Concert"
and date like "201712%"
;

id	    name	            gender	height	hair_color	car_make	car_model	event_name
78881	Red Korb	        female	65	    red	        Tesla	    Model S	    SQL Symphony Concert
90700	Regina George	    female	66	    red	        Tesla	    Model S	    SQL Symphony Concert
99716	Miranda Priestly	female	66	    red	        Tesla	    Model S	    SQL Symphony Concert

One of these three is the Mastermind;
try id 99716

Did you find the killer?

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');

        SELECT value FROM solution;

value
Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! 
Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time.
